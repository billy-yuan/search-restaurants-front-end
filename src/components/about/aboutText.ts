  **Search Eater** is a side project created by me, Billy Yuan, that provides a easy way to search for restaurants that have been
  featured on [Eater NY](https://ny.eater.com/).

  I've always enjoyed going on Eater to find a place to eat for various occasions and have rarely been disappointed by a restaurant that they write about. However,
  **the search engine on their website is built for searching for articles, not specific restaurants.**

  **To solve this problem, I decided to build a tool that combines some of the search capabilities from Yelp with the restaurants featured on Eater NY.**
