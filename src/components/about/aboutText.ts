  Search Eater is a side project created by me, Billy Yuan, that provides a easy way to search for restaurants that have been
  featured on Eater NY.

  I've always enjoyed going on Eater to find a place to eat for various occasions and have rarely been disappointed by a restaurant that write about. However,
  the search engine on their website is built for searching for articles, not specific restaurants.
